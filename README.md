# InstagramLightbox
A simple client-side app to display the images from an Instagram feed.

On page load, redirects to Instagram for authentication. On success, displays a simple lightbox view of the authenticated user's Instagram feed with "previous" and "next" navigation buttons.

NOTE: Instagram integration is currently in sandbox mode, and so is limited to displaying the 20 most recent images for the authenticated user.
